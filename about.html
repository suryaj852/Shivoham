    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Dear Loved ones,</p>
    <p>We are a group of healers who are helping humanity with the grace of the Divine. "Love all and serve all" is our vision. Please choose the appropriate healers who can help you improve the quality of your life by connecting you with the Divine. We believe that only compassion can heal people and only compassionate people can act as instruments of the Divine.</p>
    <p>Release your stress, anxiety, fear, confusion, imbalance, anger, and sexual blockages.</p>
    <p>Improve your life by imbibing patience, compassion, tolerance, resilience, and unconditional love into your being.</p>
    <p>Relationship issues and financial problems can be sorted out by working deeply within — by examining both the dark and light patterns of the mind.</p>
    <p>There are patterns that block self-growth, and there are patterns that help you evolve. Healing comes from identifying and integrating the right patterns into your consciousness so that you live a wholistic and holistic life.</p>
    <p>Here is a group of healers who can help you. Choose them wisely based on your soul's needs.</p>
    <h2>Vijay Amirtharaj Selvaraj</h2>
    <p>Vijay works with the karmic patterns individuals carry over many lifetimes. He helps people understand themselves through the grace of Divine energy. This grace enables him to identify and dissolve blockages in the physical, mental, and astral bodies.</p>
    <p>He specializes in addressing deep-rooted mental health issues that are connected to dark subconscious patterns. These patterns attract negative energies from other dimensions. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A person craving power may attract power-based entities.</li>
      <li>A person focused on money may resonate with money-related astral energies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Desires are not bad. But unlimited craving can energetically bind an individual to entities from other dimensions — entities that embody ego, dominance, manipulation, and exploitation. These associations can create karmic contracts that disturb balance, peace, and harmony in one’s life on Mother Earth.</p>
    <p>Vijay offers personalized Tantra Yoga practices to help individuals release these karmic contracts. He uses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Past life regression</li>
      <li>Yogic therapy</li>
      <li>Astral healing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>His work helps people transform into compassionate beings who uplift their families, communities, and the cosmos itself.</p>
    <p><strong>Self-transformation starts within.</strong></p>
